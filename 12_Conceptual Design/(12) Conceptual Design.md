==================================================
## Keep is Short and Simple ( KISS )
==================================================

    - Look at every word and sentence
    - Consider using multi-sensory metaphors that tap more memory zones
    - test it on all kinds of other people

==================================================
## Make it Easy to Understand
==================================================

    - Crate a consistent visual strategy
    - use more shapes than lines
    - use an animation to encourage an interaction
    - use precise vocabulary
    - break patterns when it is necessary

==================================================
## Make Progress to User Visible
==================================================

    - Reduce user's uncertainty
    - Offer a reason to wait and reduce userd preception of time

==================================================
## Make Progress Meaningful
==================================================

Everyday we're rewarded ecen if we're not aware of it.

    - informational
    - Social
    - Gemification
    - Monetization

==================================================
## Make Successful Completion Clearly Visible
==================================================

Precent-done progress indicators are the most informative type of wait-animation feedback. Avoid useng static progress indicators.
