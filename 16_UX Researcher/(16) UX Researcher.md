===============================================

### 1. Why most product lunch fail

No market research.

### 2. User for Design

    1. User-centered design - > interviewing, observing, collecting data.
    2. User-scented design -> quessing, assuming, potentialy going terribly wrong

### 3. What is UX

The user experience is how a user interact with and experiences a product, system or service.

### 4. User Journey

    1. Don't create customer journey maps wothout personas
    2. Don't make maps too high-level
    3. Don't make maps too low-level

### 5.  Stakeholder Circles

UX is not working alone

    1. UX -> Designer, Researcher, tech writers
    2. Bussiness -> Uooer management, product managers, marketing people, salespeople
    3. Engineering -> engineers, QA people, Tech support

### 6. When to do Research?

New Product Development Process

    1. Idea Generation
    2. Screening -> ROI Estimate
    3. Idea Evaluation -> Concept Testing, ROI Verification
    4. Development -> R&D, Build Model, Text in Market, ROI Estimate, Revise Product
    5. Product Evaluation -> Finalize Product, Finalize Marketing Plan, Final ROI Estimate, Strat Marketing Plan, STart New Production

When :

    1. Exploratory -> To discovery opportunities for new initiative
    2. Generative -> To understand more between several concepts
    3. Evaluative -> To discover are Improvement

### 7. Step by Step : Crate Goals

#### 1. Understand the background

    a. Ask your stakeholders what they want to learn
    b. Collect and study the available data first

#### 2. Write down the goal

    a. Try to be concice and narrow down the goals to a specific aspect of users behaviour / attitudes

### 8. Step by Step : Define Participant Criteria

Prefer extreme users

### 9. Step by Step : Define Number of Participants Needed

The best result come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small test as you can afford

### 10. Step by Step : Develop Research Guideline

#### 1. Opening : Ice Breaking, Gives more context
    a. Getting to know the participant
    b. General behaviour questions
    c. Usability testing topic related questions

#### 2. Usability Testing Task

#### 3. Closing : Rating and Feedback

    a. Ask the participant to rate the experience
    b. Likes, Dislike & Feedback to improve the experience
    c. Any other general feedback ( if any )

### 11. Step by Step : Write Usability Testing Task

#### 1.  Start from most generic thing that the participant would do an the first page before moving on the specific task

#### 2. Task should be written specifically so all the participants would have same goal

### 12. Step by Step : Dos and Don'ts during the testing

    1. Tell the participant that you're testing your design, not them, this is not exam
    2. Pbserve and take notes on things that participants do on your design. A screen recorder would help you to recall the journey later
    3. Allow the participants to explore first, answer the questions after the session finished
    4. Encourage the participant to speak out loud
    5. Ask the follow up question after the participant finished the task
    6. Do not ask leading question or express the non-neutral statement

## Evaluative Research
===============================================

Ebaluative research, also known as evaluation research or program evaluation, is a type of research you can use to evaluate a product or concept and collect data that helps improve your solution

### 1. Choose UX Researh Method

    - Shorter feedback loops of interviews, card sorts, or usability test
    - very early in product development -> field studies
    - mockups or a prototype -> usability testing
    - Secondary data, such as research that's already been done in your organization or desk research
    - Conversations with your users -> User interviews
    - Study of a group of people -> Focus groups
    - get a peek into how users interact with our product in a real-world scenario -> diary studies.

### 2. Ideation Workshop

After sharing the insights, we also run the ideation workshop to discuss the users experience ( especially the pain points ) and brainstorm on how to improve the experience
