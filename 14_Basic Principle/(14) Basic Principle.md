# Design Laguage
-----------------------------

## Skeuomorphic
=============================

In product design, we define skeuomorphism as a tecnique used in UI design where objects, icons, and buttons mimic their real-world counterparts

Disadvantage :
    
    - Most users had already learned how to use the interfaces
    - difficult to scale a design
    - longer loading times and more bandwidth consumed

## Flat Design
=============================

Minimalism at its core, the goal behind this language was to remove all purely decorative elements and make the desind purely utilitarian.

Disadvantages :

    - Difficult for new user
    - Harder to predict how elements will behave

## Material Design
=============================

This design system is a more balanced interpretation of flat 2.0 and attempts to marry the real and digital worlds. Material design about using mostly flat elements with subtle #D touches.

Disadvantages :

    - A bit tricky to use shadow
    - Similiar to flat design

=============================
# 10 Principle of Good Design
-----------------------------

## 1. Innovative

Practical implementation of ideas that result in the introduction of new goods or services or improvement in offering goods or services

## 2. Makes a product useful

Good design emphasizes in the fact that products solve a problem in a useful way

## 3. Aesthetic

Includes factors such as balance, color, movement, pattern, scale, shape, and visual weight.

## 4. Makes a Product Understandable

There's nothing better designed than a product that explains itself and so it's in a digital product

## 5. Honest

Digital product shouldn't manipulate the way and user will interact with it to avoid generating unnecessary frustation

## 6. long-lasting

Designing products that last not only means that they don't strictly follow the trends of the moment but also they set their own trends, having always the user in mind

## 7. Thorough down to the last detail

As the old idiom says " The devil is in the detail " and as designers we should try to see always the bigger picture to avoid all the small elements that seemed simple at first sight could become.

## 8. Environmentally friendly

While at first sight, this should be an obvious reference to the way we think and design physical products, there are ways to help our planet when designing digital products as well.

## 9. As little Design as Possible

Build up the minimalism movement in architecture, It also set the lines to look for a way of reinvent the way we design products today.

=============================
# Color Theory
-----------------------------

The research provided by colorcom showed that it takes only 90 seconds for people to make a subconscious judgment about a product and between 62% and 90% assessment is based on color alone

## 1. Color Wheel

THe coloe circle is usually built of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. The primary are those three pigment. Colors that can not be formed by any combination of other colors

## 2. Color Models

The additive color model consider red, blue, and green as primary color so it's also known as RGB color system.

The subtractive color model obtains colors by the substraction of light. It consists of two color systems.

    - The firts is RYB ( red, yellow, blue )
    - CMYK ( cyan, magenta, yellow, and black )

## 3. Color Harmony

The color harmony is about the arrangement of the colors in design in the most attractive and effective way for users'perception.

    - Split-Complementary
    - Triadic
    - Tetradic
    - Monochormatic
    - Analogous
    - Complementary

### 1. Monochromatic

It is based an one color with various tones and shades of it.

### 2. Analogous

To create analogous harmony, you need to use colors located right next to each other on the color wheel

### 3. Complementary

The complementary scheme is the mix of colors placed in front of each other on the color wheel.

### 4. Split-Complementary

This scheme works similiar to the previous one but it employs more colors

### 5. Triadic

WHen the design required more colors you can try triadic scheme

### 6. Tetredic / Double-Complementary

The tetradic color scheme is for the ecperienced designers since it is the most difficukt ti balance
