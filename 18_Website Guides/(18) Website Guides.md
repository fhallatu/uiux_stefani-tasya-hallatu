# Website Guides
----------------------------------------------------

## 1. Don’t Make Me (or Anyone) Think

They want to know what they should do immediately and then do it

## 2. Design for scanning, not reading

    - Use universally accepted conventions
    - Create visual hierarchies
    - Make obvious what’s clickable
    - Not confronting you with all the details at once

## 3. Time Wasting Sucks

People go online to save time not to spend it

## 4. Let Me Go Back

Mistakes don’t matter too much from a user’s perspective

## 5. People are Habitual

If something works well – people will tend to stick to using that

## 6. Get to the Point

    - Again with the time saving – people don’t look for pleasantries on the internet. 
    - Make clicks mindless
    - It is necessary to remove any filler words or sentences.

## 7. Some People Love Search

There’s a certain group of users who have become search-dependent

## 8. Don’t Change the Map

    - People remember the experience of interacting with websites and applications.
    - Persistent Navigation
    - Page Names
    - ‘You are here’ navigation

## 9. Show Them the Way to Go Home

The home button is the ultimate emergency exit for users.

## 10. Don’t argue but test

Testing with real users opens up a whole new dimension to the discussion and also helps everyone involved to re-learn about their assumptions.

    - Usability Testing — Do it regularly
    - Frequency
    - Number of users
    - Testing
    - Focus

## 11. Increase your Reservoir of Goodwill

    - Make the most important things that your user would want to do on your site as easy as possible
    - Be upfront about the information that users would want to view
    - Save steps where ever you can
    - It good to apologise to the user when you are not able to do what the user expects i.e.404 page or some limiting functionality that you know user would want but for some reason you cannot provide it
