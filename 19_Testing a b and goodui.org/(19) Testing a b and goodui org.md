# A/B Testing Guide
-------------------------------------------------------

## What is A/B Testing ?
=======================================================

A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, etc.) 

## Why should you consider A/B test ?
=======================================================

    - Solve visitor pain points
    - Get better ROI from existing traffic
    - Reduce bounce rate
    - Redesign website to increase future business gains
    - Achieve statistically significant improvements
    - Make low-risk modifications

## What can you A/B test ?
=======================================================

### 1. Copy

    - Headlines and subheadlines
    - Body
    - Subject lines

### 2. Navigation

    - Match visitor expectations
    - Make your website’s navigation predictable
    - Creating a fluid, easy-to-navigate website

### 3. Design and layout

    - Provide clear information
    - Highlight customer reviews
    - Write simple content
    - Create a sense of urgency

### 4. Forms

### 5. CTA (Call-to-action)

### 6. Content depth

### 7. Social proof

## Different types of A/B tests
=======================================================

    - Advantages of Split URL testing
    - Multipage testing
    - Multivariate testing (MVT)

## A/B testing statistical approach
=======================================================

### 1. Frequentist Approach

    - Frequentist Statistics follow the ‘Probability as Long-Term Frequency’ definition of probability.
    - In this approach, you only use data from your current experiment. The frequentist solution is to conduct tests and draw conclusions.
    - Give an estimated mean (and standard deviation) of samples where A beats B but completely ignores the cases when B beats A.
    - Requires the test to run for a set period to get correct data from it but can’t figure out how close or far A and B actually are. It fails to tell you the probability of A beating B.

### 2. Bayesian Approach

    - Bayesian Statistics follow the notions of ‘Probability as Degree of Belief’ and ‘Logical Probability.’
    - In this approach, you use your prior knowledge from the previous experiments and try to incorporate that information into your current data. The Bayesian solution is to use existing data to draw conclusions.
    - It takes into account the possibility of A beating B and also calculates the range of the improvement you can expect.
    - Gives you more control over testing. You can now plan better, have a more accurate reason to end tests, and get into the nitty-gritty of how close or far apart A and B are.

## How to perform an A/B Test?
=======================================================

    - Research
    - Observe and formulate hypothesis
    - Create variations
    - Run test
    - Analyse results and deploy changes

## Conclusion
=======================================================

Follow each step involved diligently and be wary of all major and minor mistakes that you can commit if you do not give data the importance it deserves. A/B testing is invaluable when it comes to improving your website’s conversion rates.
